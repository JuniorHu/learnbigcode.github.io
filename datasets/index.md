Sharing datasets in a research community has a number of advantages. It allows for meaningful comparison between systems and enables researchers to spend more time on developing state-of-the-art methods as opposed to collecting and cleaning data.



In case a dataset is useful for a specific task, a <a href="/challenges">challenge</a> can be created such that other people try to solve the same problem.


<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="javascript-asts">JavaScript ASTs</h1>

<p>This dataset includes 100'000 + 50'000 JavaScript files. The data is available as JavaScript and as parsed abstract syntax trees (parsed with acorn.js and serialized in a JSON format as described in the link)<br>

<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="githubjava">Java GitHub corpus</h1>

<p>This dataset includes about 14k Java files from GitHub, split into training and test set.
The files are from open source projects that have been forked at least once.

<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="naturalize">Java Variable and Method Naming Dataset and Embeddings</h1>

<p>This dataset includes the Java source code and JSON serialized files containing their tokens and the locations of the tokens that refer to the same variable. It also contains pre-trained embeddings for variable and method names.<br/>

<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="estimatingTypesDataset">Estimating Types in Stripped Binaries Dataset</h1>

<p>This dataset includes 20 stripped binaries used as benchmarks for evaluate estimation of object types and virtual function call targets. 
It also contains the ground-truth determined for the object types. 
The binaries were collected from publically availalble open-source projects, compiled with default optimizations and stripped.
The dataset is provided in the form of a VM containing a Mongo database holding the data (see README for further details).
