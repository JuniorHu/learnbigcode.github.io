Sharing datasets in a research community has a number of advantages. It allows for meaningful comparison between systems and enables researchers to spend more time on developing state-of-the-art methods as opposed to collecting and cleaning data.



In case a dataset is useful for a specific task, a <a href="/challenges">challenge</a> can be created such that other people try to solve the same problem.


<div class="highlightitem">
<h1 id="javascript-asts">JavaScript ASTs</h1>

<p>This dataset includes 100'000 + 50'000 JavaScript files. The data is available as JavaScript and as parsed abstract syntax trees (parsed with acorn.js and serialized in a JSON format as described in the link)<br>
