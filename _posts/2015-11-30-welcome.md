This site is a result of a Dagstuhl seminar <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15472">Programming from Big Code</a>

Its goal is to keep as an access point where researchers and practitioners can collaborate and define the important challenges of the community.
The site should be able to act as:

* access point where developers can find links to working tools that leverage "Big Code"
* a collection of challenges and datasets that allow the research community to jointly solve important problems and/or compare solutions.

This website should not be a replacement for scientific conferences, thus "publishing" here should in principle be done only after publishing elsewhere. This is not a PR site of any research group.
