* <a href="/tools/decomp">Decompilation and Deobfuscation</a> are tools that reverse the process of compilation or obfuscation. These tools use "Big Code" to make their output human-readable and understandable.
* <a href="/tools/stats">Code Statistics</a> aim to predict facts about programs (e.g. bugs) based on statistics from the code.
