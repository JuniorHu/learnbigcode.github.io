Typically a challenge consists of a dataset and a task that should be performed and evaluated with a specific dataset. The goal of challenges is for the research community to define important problems on which multiple solutions should appear. Most challenges already include some system as a baseline and the goal is to produce a better working (e.g. more precise) system. Challenges should be selt-contained -- it should take a few hours for a newcomer to implement a naive solution to a challenge.

<h2>JavaScript code completion challenge</h2>

<p>A number of works in the recent years create statistical code completion systems. This challenge represent a difficult cases where JavaScript is a target language. Furthermore, the lack of static type information makes code completion a challenge with existing non-statistical techniques.</p>

<p>The goal is to create a tool that can predict JavaScript code. One task is for predicting APIs and object fields as in the classical code completion setting, but another task proposes to complete arbitrary program elements such as numeric and string constants.<br>
